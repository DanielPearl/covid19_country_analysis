# IST 707 Data Analytics

<!-- Class and Project Description
  The Data Analytics course taught by Lin Ying and Bei Yu, introduced the
concepts of machine learning through R. Data mining, cleaning, and analysis were a large focus of this class. More specifically, an emphasis was placed on association rule mining, classification analysis, clustering analysis, and their application to real life problems. The assignments that reflected these concepts included creating an association rule mining analysis for grocery store shelving, solving the unknown writers of the Federalist Papers using a variety of classification techniques, creating a lie detection model from a list of restaurant reviews, and identifying handwritten digits using classification analysis. The class during this term paralleled the beginning of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic and thus, the project attempted to analyze early indicators relating to infection and death rates.
  The dataset for this project was retrieved from Kaggle and contains data
collected by The World Bank, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Our World in Data, The United Nations, and national government reports. The information within the dataset relates to 209 territories with the latest update being made on May 19, 2020. The purpose of this project was to determine which indicators were associated with an increase infection/death rate. Around 15 indicators were included in the analysis. Some of these indicators were population density, total tests per thousand, age, and diabetes prevalence. Once the data was imported into R, various pre-processing steps were undertaken. The columns that were not of interest were removed and null values were replaced by the column mean. The next step involved discretizing the dependent variable columns to more easily interpret the results. These values were categorized according to the infection/death rate frequency in terms of ‘very low’, ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’, and ‘very high’. Various other independent columns were discretized such as age, total tests, tests per thousand, GDP per capita, smokers, handwash stations, and hospital beds. Finally, various classification models were created to determine if these indicators were related to the difference observed between the infection/death rate in each country. Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor models were all used in this analysis. The accuracy and predictions yielded by each of these models were inconclusive.

Learning Objectives
  By focusing on finding patterns in data through data mining concepts and
algorithms, data stories can be communicated. The covid-19 project accomplishes this by using the various classification models learned throughout the course. It breaks down each of the potential country indicators related to this pandemic and determines which are most likely to have an effect. It attempts to paint a picture of how and why each country is impacted differently. Though the data size and indicators didn’t show a definitive conclusion, the culture, political decisions, and economic status of each country are potential contributors. Problems like this are abundant in the real world where one or many independent variables are responsible for the differences in the dependent variables. When the relationship is known, certain actions can be taken to mitigate negative consequences. For example, if it is known that older people are more susceptible to the virus, protective measures can be taken. Another example might be a government spending more on hospital beds or handwash stations if they are found to lower the infection/death rate. It is important to understand the process of cleaning and preparing data before it can be analyzed. Discretization, removing null values, and selecting desirable variables are all potentially very important pre-processing steps for any kind of analysis. In addition, the way the data is structure is quite valuable depending on the type of analysis being performed. This project combines data extraction, data cleaning, data analysis, visualization, and communication.
